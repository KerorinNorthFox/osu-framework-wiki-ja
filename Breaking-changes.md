Occasionally we will make changes which require consumers of the framework to make amendments to maintain compatibility. Wherever possible, we maintain compatibility via `[Obsolete]` attributes, but it is encouraged that you leave obsolete warnings turned on an deal with them sooner rather than later. Generally we aim to leave obsolete methods around for 3-6 months after obsoletion.

This page serves to give a list of all breaking/major changes.

# [2019.427.0](https://github.com/ppy/osu-framework/releases/tag/2019.427.0)

## `Drawable.ApplyDrawNode()` has been removed

The direction of application of `DrawNode` states has been inversed.

Previously:
```csharp
class MyCustomDrawable : Drawable
{
    private bool state;

    protected override DrawNode CreateDrawNode() => new CustomDrawNode();

    protected override void ApplyDrawNode(DrawNode node)
    {
        base.ApplyDrawNode(node);

        var n = (CustomDrawNode)n;
        
        n.State = state; 
    }

    private class CustomDrawNode : DrawNode
    {
        public bool State;
    }
}
```

Now:
```csharp
class MyCustomDrawable : Drawable
{
    private bool state;

    protected override DrawNode CreateDrawNode() => new CustomDrawNode(this);

    private class CustomDrawNode : DrawNode
    {
        protected new MyCustomDrawable Source => (MyCustomDrawable)base.Source;

        private bool state;

        public CustomDrawNode(MyCustomDrawable source)
            : base(source)
        {
        }

        public override void ApplyState()
        {
            base.ApplyState();

            state = Source.state;
        }
    }
}
```

## The namespace of `EdgeEffectParameters` and `EdgeEffectType` has changed

They now reside in `osu.Framework.Graphics.Effects`.

# [2019.327.0](https://github.com/ppy/osu-framework/releases/tag/2019.327.0)

## Font fallback order changes [#2296](https://github.com/ppy/osu-framework/pull/2296)

Games adding their own fonts can now do so directly to `Game.Fonts`. Fallback (framework-side) fonts are now always at the lowest priority.

Previously:
```csharp
// this completely overrides the framework default. will need to change once we make a proper FontStore.
dependencies.Cache(Fonts = new FontStore(new GlyphStore(Resources, @"Fonts/FontAwesome")));
Fonts.AddStore(new GlyphStore(Resources, @"Fonts/osuFont"));
```

now:
```csharp
Fonts.AddStore(new GlyphStore(Resources, @"Fonts/osuFont"));
```

## FontAwesome and SpriteIcon is provided by the framework [#2293](https://github.com/ppy/osu-framework/pull/2293)

If you manually added either of these to your project, please remove them.

Usage:
```csharp
new SpriteIcon
{
    Icon = FontAwesome.Refresh,
};
```

# [2019.319.0](https://github.com/ppy/osu-framework/releases/tag/2019.319.0)

## Parameter order of `AddUntilStep` / `AddWaitStep` reversed [#2256](https://github.com/ppy/osu-framework/pull/2256)

In order to standardise parameter order, these two methods' parameters have been reversed. Old parameter order methods are available temporarily (as `[Obsolete]`) to ease migration.

## New attribute `[SetUpSteps]` added [#2266](https://github.com/ppy/osu-framework/pull/2266)

Finally allows steps to be added that will run before every `[Test]` method.

# [2019.221.0](https://github.com/ppy/osu-framework/releases/tag/2019.221.0)

## Implicit operator removed from `Bindable` [#2152](https://github.com/ppy/osu-framework/pull/2152)

In order to avoid accidental misuse / misunderstandings, `.Value` must always be added to `Bindable` when requesting its value. One such case which used to be confusing:

```csharp
Bindable<Drawable> bindableDrawable = new Bindable<Drawable>();

if (bindableDrawable != null)
{
    // true
}

if (bindableDrawable.Value != null)
{
    // false
}

Drawable drawable = null;

if (bindableDrawable == drawable)
{
    // ???
}
```

## Bindable.ValueChanged now provides `ValueChangedEvent` [#2012](https://github.com/ppy/osu-framework/pull/2012)

It is now possible to access the old value. This was a common requirement in bindable usage which we had issues with until now.

```csharp

bindable.ValueChanged += e =>
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Value changed from {e.OldValue} to {e.NewValue}");
}
```

## Introduction of `FontUsage` [#2043](https://github.com/ppy/osu-framework/pull/2043)

While old methods of setting font attributes will still work, they are now marked as `[Obsoleted]`. You should use `Font = new FontUsage(size: 200)` going forward. For convenience, you can adjust existing fonts like so:

```csharp
var font = new FontUsage(family: "SourceCodePro");

var fontWithSize = font.With(size: 24);
```
