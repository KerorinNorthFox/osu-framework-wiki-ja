## Targeting desktop platforms
You can find this code and more to help you get started in [`SampleGame`](https://github.com/ppy/osu-framework/tree/master/SampleGame) and [`SampleGame.Desktop`](https://github.com/ppy/osu-framework/tree/master/SampleGame.Desktop)

### Create a new WinExe project. 

In Visual Studio or Rider, simply set the project type to "Windows Application" when creating a new solution. You can verify whether or not you have succeeded by opening the .csproj file generated by the solution in your preferred editor and checking that the `<OutputType>Exe</OutputType>` tag exists.

In dotnet CLI, `dotnet new console` will create a new project in the current directory with the same project name. 

### Install the nuget package.
You can find the nuget package at https://www.nuget.org/packages/ppy.osu.Framework/

From dotnet CLI: `dotnet add package ppy.osu.Framework`

You can also add the package from the NuGet GUI. In rider, you can find this in Tools > Nuget > Manage NuGet Packages for Solution.

### Create a new game class that derives osu.Framework.Game.

The following code creates a cube with a rigid body container.
```csharp
namespace AwesomeGame
{
    public class AwesomeGame : Game
    {
        RigidBodySimulation sim;
        
        [BackgroundDependencyLoader]
        private void load()
        {
            Child = sim = new RigidBodySimulation { RelativeSizeAxes = Axes.Both };
            
            RigidBodyContainer<Drawable> rbc = new RigidBodyContainer<Drawable>
            {
                Child = new Box
                {
                    Anchor = Anchor.Centre,
                    Origin = Anchor.Centre,
                    Size = new Vector2(150, 150),
                    Colour = Color4.Tomato,
                },
                Position = new Vector2(500, 500),
                Size = new Vector2(200, 200),
                Rotation =  45,
                Colour = Color4.Tomato,
                Masking = true,
            };
            
            sim.Add(rbc);            
        }
    }
}
```
### In your main() method, create a new instance of your game.
```csharp
[STAThread]
public static void Main()
{
   using (Game game = new AwesomeGame())
   using (GameHost host = Host.GetSuitableHost(@"awesome-game"))
      host.Run(game);
}
```
### BackgroundDependencyLoader Attribute
The [BackgroundDependencyLoader](https://github.com/ppy/osu-framework/blob/master/osu.Framework/Allocation/BackgroundDependencyLoaderAttribute.cs) attribute denotes a method to be the load method of a [Drawable](https://github.com/ppy/osu-framework/blob/master/osu.Framework/Graphics/Drawable.cs). You can specify a type in the method parameters to attempt to grab an object of that type that has been [cached](https://github.com/ppy/osu-framework/blob/master/osu.Framework/Caching/Cached.cs).

## Testing
### Setting up a test browser
osu-framework has a visual testing framework that is meant to help provide tests that can be verified both visually and systematically via [NUnit](https://nunit.org/). To start using visual tests, you will need to create a [TestBrowser](https://github.com/ppy/osu-framework/blob/master/osu.Framework/Testing/TestBrowser.cs) and add it to your game. In order for your test browser to discover tests, you will need to specify a namespace in which for the browser to look in when constructing it.
```csharp
namespace AwesomeGame.VisualTests
{
    public class AwesomeGameTestRunner : AwesomeGame
    {
         [BackgroundDependencyLoader]
         private void load()
         {
             Child = new DrawSizePreservingFillContainer
             {
                 Children = new Drawable[]
                 {
                     new TestBrowser("AwesomeGame"), //Specify the namespace to discover tests from
                     new CursorContainer(),
                 },
             };
         }

         public override void SetHost(GameHost host)
         {
             base.SetHost(host);
             host.Window.CursorState |= CursorState.Hidden;
         }
    }
}
```

Note that in order for you to be able to run the visual tests, you will have to switch your game type to visual tests. To do that, you can either create your visual tests in a separate project and run them as a build configuration, or simply apply build configuration pre-processor checks in your entry point to run the appropriate game.

For example, if I have the VisualTests build configuration, rider will automatically create the pre-processor flag VISUALTESTS, which allows us to use `#if VISUALTESTS` to check the current build configuration.

```csharp
namespace AwesomeGame
{
    class Program
    {
        [STAThread]
        public static void Main()
        {
#if VISUALTESTS
            using (Game game = new VisualTestRunner())
#else
            using (Game game = new AwesomeGame())
#endif
            using (GameHost host = Host.GetSuitableHost(@"AwesomeGame"))
                host.Run(game);
        }
    }
}
```

### Adding tests to the test browser

Now that our test browser is discovering tests from the specified namespace, we can start adding tests! To do so, create a new class that derives [TestCase](https://github.com/ppy/osu-framework/blob/master/osu.Framework/Testing/TestCase.cs) with the [TestFixture](http://nunit.org/docs/2.6/testFixture.html) attribute. From here, we can add steps to this test of various types:
* [AddStep](https://github.com/ppy/osu-framework/blob/d2d47c58585e6ceb8fcf4d296bc4a993753c2a1d/osu.Framework/Testing/TestCase.cs#L280) creates a step that runs a method. Completes successfully if no exceptions are caught.
* [AddRepeatStep](https://github.com/ppy/osu-framework/blob/d2d47c58585e6ceb8fcf4d296bc4a993753c2a1d/osu.Framework/Testing/TestCase.cs#L293) creates a step that runs a method a specified amount of times. Completes successfully if no exceptions are caught.
* [AddToggleStep](https://github.com/ppy/osu-framework/blob/d2d47c58585e6ceb8fcf4d296bc4a993753c2a1d/osu.Framework/Testing/TestCase.cs#L301) toggles a flag.
* [AddUntilStep](https://github.com/ppy/osu-framework/blob/d2d47c58585e6ceb8fcf4d296bc4a993753c2a1d/osu.Framework/Testing/TestCase.cs#L309) adds a step that attempts to run until a condition becomes true, or fails when it times out.
* [AddWaitStep](https://github.com/ppy/osu-framework/blob/d2d47c58585e6ceb8fcf4d296bc4a993753c2a1d/osu.Framework/Testing/TestCase.cs#L317) adds a step that waits a specified amount of time before continuing to the next step.
* [AddSliderStep](https://github.com/ppy/osu-framework/blob/d2d47c58585e6ceb8fcf4d296bc4a993753c2a1d/osu.Framework/Testing/TestCase.cs#L325) adds a step that creates a slider-bar that adjusts a set value.
* [AddAssert](https://github.com/ppy/osu-framework/blob/d2d47c58585e6ceb8fcf4d296bc4a993753c2a1d/osu.Framework/Testing/TestCase.cs#L333) creates a step that fails if the specified value does not return true.

### Example Test
The following code adds a simple cube to the visual test browser that we created above. The cube has a rigid body attached, and should drop to the bottom of the screen when created. From here, we can choose to check the behavior of the cube by asserting that the cube eventually reaches the bottom via AddAssert.

```csharp
namespace AwesomeGame.VisualTests
{
    [TestFixture]
    public class RigidCubeTest : TestCase
    {
        private RigidBodySimulation sim;

        [Test]
        public void AwesomeTestName()
        {
            AddStep("Drop a cube", DropCube);
        }

        private void DropCube()
        {
            Child = sim = new RigidBodySimulation { RelativeSizeAxes = Axes.Both };
            
            RigidBodyContainer<Drawable> rbc = new RigidBodyContainer<Drawable>
            {
                Child = new Box
                {
                    Anchor = Anchor.Centre,
                    Origin = Anchor.Centre,
                    Size = new Vector2(150, 150),
                    Colour = Color4.Tomato,
                },
                Position = new Vector2(500, 500),
                Size = new Vector2(200, 200),
                Rotation =  45,
                Colour = Color4.Tomato,
                Masking = true,
            };
            
            sim.Add(rbc);
        }
    }
}
```

### Setup Attribute
The [Setup](https://nunit.org/docs/2.2/setup.html) NUnit attribute marks a method as a setup method that runs as a step before every group of tests in a test method. The steps created by this attribute gets added to the visual test browser as well.
